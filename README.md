# epub_align

## TODO :
1. Put ways to quantify how similar two epubs are in terms of structure, and whether to align by section or by paragraph/sentence.
2. Check to see if the epub's toc is the same as the list of files in the archive, and if not, what to do in that scenario.
3. Find a way to find the true start of the novel, and skip the copyright section.
4. More finegrained control on vecalign and the way the paragraphs/text is produced and stored
